# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Lousie is attempting to decide whether she should run a Kickstarter campaign to fund her $10,000 play *Fever*. The purpose of this project was to figure out how Louise's play would compare to other similar Kickstarter projects in terms of fundraising and what factors made certain similar projects successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges
A collection of statistics from various Kickstarter campaigns were whittled down to only include plays, which included information about fundraising goals, amount of money pledged, country of origin, dates of the campaign, and text included in campaign. Analysis stemmed from both data coalesced in a pivot table, showing the correlation between successful campaigns and months the campaigns launched, and also a worksheet showing the correlation between fundraising goals and chance of success. 

A significant challenge for me was the "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet, as finding the right order and method of building equations felt complicated. COUTIFS were definitely the most difficult concept to learn in class, so utilizing them correctly invloved following multiple tutorials from Microsoft and third-party sources. 

## Results
Theater campaigns were significantly more successful when they launched in May, followed by June and July. Theater campaigns were the least successful during November, December, and January. Campaigns with fundraising goals between $0 and $14,999 had higher rates of success than other campaigns, with campaigns from $20,000 to $34,999 having significantly low rates of success. So, if I was advising Louise, I would assure her that her *Fever* play has a reasonable enough fundraising campaign to get a solid chance at success, but I would launch in May to boost her odds of meeting her goal. However, the data is both limited to only Kickstarter, not including other crowdfunding websites, as well as not including data from campaigns after 2017. Additional suggestions could stem from data analyzing certain terms/phrases in successful campaigns, as well as the presence of photo/video content, and including more recent data.
